I'm not that easy to tame
You should see me under
these lights,
all my tears turn to ice
That's the sweetest escape
Every time that feeling kicks in
I might stay through the night
Bet you get it now
Rocked that, didn't I?
착각 하지마 누가 누군지
Woah
Think you're running that
Guess we gunnin' back
You know I walk it, yeah,
I talk it
눈감고, 하나, 둘, 셋
(뛰어)
뛰어
뛰어
뛰어
뛰어
So come up with me,
I'll take you high
That Primadonna spice up
your life
You know I got that shit
that you like
So come up with me, run up, uh,
jump
(뛰어)
Watch me runnin' up the place
I'm already stuntin' and
my girls are on the way
(뛰어)
Watch me open up the place
Wanna see you bumpin', baby,
bouncin' to the bass
Are you not entertained?
(No)
I ain't gotta explain
(No)
I'm with all of my sisters
(Yeah)
got 'em going insane
(Yeah)
You know we on a mission
(Yeah)
all gas, no brakes, yeah
Breaking out of the system,
breaking out of this cage, yeah
Bet you get it now
Ate that, didn't I?
순간 잊지마 누가 누군지
Oh
Think you runnin' that
Guess we gunnin' back
You know I walk it, yeah,
I talk it
눈감고, 하나, 둘, 셋
(뛰어)
